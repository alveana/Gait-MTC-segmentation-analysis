# Gait-MTC-segmentation-analysis
Target Based Gait Segmentation Algorithm 
Developing an algorithm to segment LMTC/RMTC target Data:
- Normal walking/No Adjustment (MTC = 0)
- Adjusted walking (MTC target present: LMTC/RMTC targets)
Data Includes:
- Joint angle files for each limb (specifically ankle, knee, hip) across various trials.
- Specific segment where the participant:
  - Walked with LMTC target
  - Walked with RMTC target
  - Walked without any target (baseline/no-adjustment)
- Frame numbers are used to align gait events and angles.
- Visual cue (red-line in Visual3D) appears when the participant sees a target. (no red line represents normal walking/no adjustment)
