•Joint angles for the whole trial of Pretest_LMTC:
LeftAnkle_Angle.txt, LeftHip_Angle.txt, LeftKnee_Angle.txt, RightAnkle_Angle.txt, RightHip_Angle.txt, RightKnee_Angle.txt

•Joint angles for both lower limbs during specific tasks:
o	When the participant tried to match the LMTC and RMTC targets (MTC targets = 0.0831 m and 0.0731 m)
o	When the participant walked without seeing any LMTC targets (resting/walking, similar to baseline) (MTC targets = 0)

For reference: The joint angle files are used to create graphs and added data to the Excel file (summary of data processing.xlsx) in the specific “Frame number (num)”. A Visual3D screenshot and the figure (comparison_target_with_LMTC.jpg & comparison_target_with_LMTC.fig) demonstrating the MTC target (red line) and LMTC (the drop before the highest peak). When no red line, the participant did not see any target and walked like baseline walking for resting. 

Once the Excel file is completed for one participant (LMTC & RMTC adaptation) and then for all participants (both old and new), this dataset could form the basis for analysis.
